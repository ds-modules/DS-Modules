This core mathematical macro-economics class has a semester's worth of problem sets.  The first notebook illustrates how a notebook can be illustrated like a textbook, with Latex external formulas, and graphical illustrations. The modeling part of the first notebook illustrates a Solow growth model with six graphical panels.  The module also uses autograding features to give immediate feedback to the students for early practice problems to let them know if they are on the right path.  The module is designed for students with little-to-no coding or statistics experience.
