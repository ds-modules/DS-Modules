Using demographic data from the 20th-21st century, this module has students analyzing how a specific Chinatown, such as SF Chinatown, has changed over time. Students use some simple computational text analysis methods to explore and compare the structures of poems written on Angel Island and in Chinatown publications from the early 20th century.  The module is designed for students with little-to-no coding or statistics experience.
