These modules connect word use in political speeches to the Moral Foundations Theory. Statistical inferences and visualizations from this data help students look for rhetoric differences between conservative and liberal presidential candidates. Students then engage with and critique data-driven methods themselves as rhetorical tools. This module is meant to take 3 class periods for students with minimal to no coding experience.
