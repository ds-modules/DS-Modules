This module works with an interesting data set, the Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL). These texts are translated from fragmented tablets as old as 6000 years. The techniques used in this module are less common in text analysis such as k-means, hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling. These provide the ability to classify a newly translated text with past Sumerian literature as well as create interesting tree graphs and clusters.  The module is designed for students with little-to-no coding or statistics experience.
