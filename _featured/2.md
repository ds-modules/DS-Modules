This module maps and visualizes socioeconomic and demographic variation across East Bay census tracts, using crowdsourced student data. Students go out into neighborhoods and make qualitative observations, and then compare to census data. Qualitative observations are mapped in the notebook to combine individual obersvations into an overall map. Students engage with the data that they have gathered, and can explore across student groups, socioeconomic categories, or geographic locations.  The module is designed for students with little-to-no coding or statistics experience.
