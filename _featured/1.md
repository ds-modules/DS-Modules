This module consists of two labs where students analyze data collected on themselves and compiled for the whole class. In the first lab, students explore closure and voice-onset time, as well as look at the effect of native language spoken and height on those numbers.  In the second lab, students analyze vowel formants and compare their vowel space to the rest of the class, investigate the predictive power of individual metadata for these characteristics. The module is designed for students with little-to-no coding or statistics experience.
