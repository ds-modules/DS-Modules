Two labs where students analyze data that they collected on themselves 
and has been compiled for the whole class. In the first lab, students 
explore closure and voice-onset time, as well as look at the effect of 
native language spoken and height on those numbers. In the second lab, 
students analyze vowel formants, and compare their vowel space to the 
rest of the class, as well as investigate the effect of individual metadata 
on those characteristics. They touch a little on prediction at the end of the 
notebook.
